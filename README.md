This is very important for the log and frame taking process of the game:

Go to Assets/Scripts/FileUpload.cs

and change the mail names and passwords accordingly with which e-mail you want to use as sender and which as the receiver. This way you will manage to send yourself the logs and frames easily from other computers.
